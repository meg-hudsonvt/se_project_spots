# Project 3: Spots

This is the third project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. This is an interactive webpage that will eventually allow users to create their own profiles and upload photos of their choice to share on their page. Viewers will be able to "like" their photos by pressing the heart underneath each photo. It is a page with a responsive design that is functional and visually appealing for desktop, tablet, or mobile screens. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.
